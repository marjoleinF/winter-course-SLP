Winter Course Statistical Learning and Prediction
========================================================

Welcome statistical learners!

This folder contains materials for the graduate course on Statistical Learning and Prediction.

Course dates are: Tuesday February 1, 2022 + Wednesday February 2, 2022.

Your instructors will be: Dr. Tom Wilderjans & Dr. Marjolein Fokkema.

In this repository, all the course materials (slides, datasets, R code, worked out solutions to exercises) will be posted.  

For now, make sure you perform the preparations as described in the corresponding PDF before the start of the course. 


We will use the following book in the course:

James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2021). An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. An introduction to statistical learning (2nd edition). New York: Springer.

You can obtain a free copy at https://www.statlearning.com/ (a direct link to the pdf: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf).

If you want to dive deeper into the mathematical and theoretical backgrounds, we recommend the Elements of Statistical Learning (also freely available at https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf).

Winter Course Statistical Learning and Prediction
========================================================

## Welcome statistical learners!

This folder contains materials for the graduate course on Statistical Learning and Prediction.

Your instructors will be: Dr. Tom Wilderjans & Dr. Marjolein Fokkema.

In this repository, all the course materials (slides, datasets, R code, worked out solutions to exercises) will be posted.  

For now, make sure you perform the preparations as described in the corresponding PDF before the start of the course. 


## Course dates, times & location

The course will take place on Tuesday February 1, 2022 + Wednesday February 2, 2022.

## Literature

We will use the following book in the course:

James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2021). An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. An introduction to statistical learning (2nd edition). New York: Springer.

You can obtain a free copy at https://www.statlearning.com/ (a direct link to the pdf: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf).

If you want to dive deeper into the mathematical and theoretical backgrounds, we recommend the Elements of Statistical Learning (also freely available at https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf).

Winter Course Statistical Learning and Prediction
========================================================

### Welcome statistical learners!

This folder contains materials for the graduate course on Statistical Learning and Prediction.

Your instructors will be: Dr. Tom Wilderjans & Dr. Marjolein Fokkema.

In this repository, all the course materials (slides, datasets, R code, worked out solutions to exercises) will be posted.  

For now, make sure you perform the preparations as described in the corresponding PDF before the start of the course. 


### Course dates, times & location

The course will take place on Tuesday February 1, 2022 + Wednesday February 2, 2022.

The program consists of five sessions:

- Session 1 Tue Feb 1 11h-13h: Marjolein Fokkema (introduction to statistical learning / bias-variance trade-off)
- Session 2 Tue Feb 1 14h-16h45: Tom Wilderjans (classification, resampling, cross-validation)
- Session 3 Tue Feb 1 17h00-18h15: Tom Wilderjans (model selection and regularization)

- Session 4 Wed Feb 2 10h-12h: Tom Wilderjans (unsupervised learning)

# Literature

We will use the following book in the course:

James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2021). An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. An introduction to statistical learning (2nd edition). New York: Springer.

You can obtain a free copy at https://www.statlearning.com/ (a direct link to the pdf: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf).

If you want to dive deeper into the mathematical and theoretical backgrounds, we recommend the Elements of Statistical Learning (also freely available at https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf).
